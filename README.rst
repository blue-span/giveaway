implementation plan
-------------------

I have a loose idea for how I want this to fit together at a low level:

- html generated by https://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html#creating-html-with-the-e-factory

  - almost as good as sxml

- state stored in sqlite3 (stdlib)

  - sql written in sql

I also originally wanted this to be a fastcgi service, but I've since given up
on that idea entirely. This was actually also the reason I discarded SBCL and
Guile as viable options. Maybe after MVP I'll look at a rewrite in a less boring
language.
